What Happens to the Brain When You Go to Jail? 
The damage caused by extended elevation of stress hormones can lead to both mental health issues and brain changes post-release.

So you’ve committed a crime – or maybe you haven’t – and you’ve moved on from a detention center to an actual jail where you’ll await your sentencing and move on to a prison, or get bailed out while awaiting your trail, or perhaps serve your time if it’s for a minor offense. What goes on inside your brain in the first few minutes you walk through those sliding doors? How does your body react? And what happens when you’ve become a free person again? 
 
The cast members of 60 Days In have a slight advantage compared to any other first-timer in that they have taken an extensive psychological test and have been vetted by a psychologist. That and they volunteered to go to jail. And we can’t forget about the fact that while behind bars they have an entire production crew looking out for their safety and well-being, both physically and psychologically. That's not the case for Joe Schmo there on his first drug charge. 
 
That first time walking into jail will undoubtedly be scary for most people, mainly due to fear of the unexpected. Clinical psychologist Dr. Jaime Blandino, a consultant for the show says, “When the body enters that kind of situation, it does some pretty reliable things.

“You get flooded with adrenaline and stress hormones, like cortisol, and chemicals that kick off a flight-or-fight response, your body's natural way of dealing with an emergency situation or a uniquely stressful situation.” 
 
This fight-or-flight response – also called an acute stress response – is what helped our ancestors, and other mammals, fight off danger and live another day. And while stepping through the doors of a jail intake area may not seem to be a life-threatening situation, that fear of the unexpected and whatever our senses process in those first few seconds will almost certainly cause this response to activate. 

For the purposes of this article, let’s say this first-timer is a person who has no mental health or substance abuse issues, both of which will have affected their brain chemistry before they were arrested. Let’s say he was arrested for possession of a stolen vehicle. He had borrowed a cousin’s car, that unbeknownst to him, was stolen a few weeks prior.

As the soon-to-be inmate enters the jail, first he’ll see and hear what’s going on around him. His other senses will be working to take in the moment, too. That information will get sent to the amygdala, the part of the brain that processes emotions.  It will interpret the sights, sounds, and smells, which may include rowdy inmates acting up as they are going through the intake process and loud, annoyed correctional officers. It probably doesn’t smell great in their either.  

The amygdala sends a distress signal to his brain’s hypothalamus – essentially the brain’s command center – and communicates with the body through the autonomic nervous system, which controls his heartbeat, breathing, and digestion.

This autonomic nervous system has two parts, the first part, which is the one directly tied to the fight-or-flight response, is the sympathetic nervous system. It’s activated by the hypothalamus after it receives the distress signal from the amygdala. It then sends a signal to the adrenal medulla part of the adrenal glands, located above the kidneys, to start producing the adrenaline (also known as epinephrine) and norepinephrine. These hormones both pump the body up and will help get our inmate ready to fight any perceived threats – or get out of the way! The hypothalamus also sends a signal to the pituitary gland in the brain to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone. This hormone stimulates the adrenal glades to produce corticosteroid, including cortisol, “the stress hormone.”

The adrenaline/epinephrine and norepinephrine circulates through the inmate’s body and causes a number of physiological changes. 

His blood pressure and respiratory rate increase and his senses become heightened. Although epinephrine and norepinephrine are similar, they also balance each other (the norepinephrine will be responsible for decreasing his heart and respiratory rate, essentially calming him down a little bit). The corticosteroids also circulate and help supply his body with stored glucose from the liver for energy, so he probably won’t be hungry as his brain and body is going through this acute stress response.

Other hormones are released as well, including estrogen, testosterone, and the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin.

According to forensic psychologist Dr. Barbara Kirwin, all of these stress hormones rise about 20 to 30 percent above the brain’s baseline. It’s important to reiterate, however, that not everyone entering a jail has a chemical or hormonal balance in the brain to begin with.

Then our inmate has his experience in jail -- and those experiences can vary greatly. Does he lay low and not have any issues with other inmates and get bailed out in a day or two? Or does his elevated stress hormones cause him to fight with other inmates, leading to him being sent to solitary confinement for a few days? His experience in jail, including how long he is in jail, and mental health upon entering jail (which for the purposes of this article, we’ve already indicated are optimal) will determine when his stress hormones start coming back down to the level they were at before walking into the jail, or his baseline.

Age may also be a factor. A juvenile diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) – which, according to the Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, is diagnosed in more than half of incarcerated juveniles -- will have a different baseline than an adult in good mental health who will have a different baseline from an adult who has a substance abuse history. 

After the initial flood of stress hormones, we do know at least one part of the brain is seriously affected. Dr. Blandino says the cerebral cortex, the part of the brain that is more sophisticated and helps in problem solving, starts shutting down. “It is part of the reason you see so many people in jail reverting to primitive kinds of behaviors and ways of relating,” she says. 

“They don’t have a choice but to simply function and figure out a way to survive. Like animals do, we try to find a tribe. We try to find connections with people, allies, people who have your back, people who are like you or have a similar background. [But] you’re still always vigilant. You still have to adapt to this higher-than-normal level of cortisol and testosterone.”

Dr. Kirwin says the flood of stress hormones in inmates will also make them become hyper-sensitive to their surroundings because they are protecting themselves. “When you’re in a smaller group situation that tends to create irritability and hostility,” she says. “You don’t become buddies [with your cellmates]. There’s more fighting and it’s almost a primitive competition for space [or] for the use of bathroom facilities.”

While some inmates may actually thrive with higher-than-normal stress hormones, many of them will have more adverse effects. They can have panic attacks and difficulty thinking, concentrating, or remembering things. They can even have paranoid or obsessive thoughts or hallucinations. 

“They have changes in their sleep cycles which then exacerbates the rest of the brain chemistry. We know we can torture people by sleep deprivation,” says Dr. Kirwin. 

These symptoms get even worse if the person is forced to spend time in solitary confinement, when hallucinating is common due to the lack of stimulation. In that scenario, the likelihood of brain damage from prolonged exposure to the stress hormones is great.

So what happens to your brain chemistry once you’re released from jail and you’re free person again? The short answer is that we really can’t say for sure. There are so many variations on the kinds of people who go to jail (and their mental health) and, as mentioned earlier, experiences within jail, that it’s almost impossible to say what would be next for a first-timer. Someone with no prior mental health issues, substance abuse issues, or brain damage (optimal brain chemistry) who didn’t have any overly stressful situations occur while in jail and was bailed out within a day or two, would probably not have long-term effects from their short-term response to stress. 

For the sake of our hypothetical first-timer, let’s be optimistic and say that’s the category he falls into. Our inmate was bailed out of jail two days later by his wife and his cousin confessed to have stolen the car before the trail even started. All charges were dropped. Our formerly incarcerated individual has an understanding boss, who doesn’t fire him, and he goes on to lead a normal life, free from any further run-ins with the law and with no residual mental health effects from the time he spent in jail with elevated stress hormones.

But if we want to get technical, Dr. Kirwin says there’s “no way” to estimate how long it would take for an inmate’s elevated stress hormones to go back to baseline post-release. It’s idiosyncratic,” she says. “At this time we have no way of measuring it.” 

There are a lot of people who are in the neuroscience of criminality field who would say if the inmates had optimal brain chemistry they would not be committing crimes.”

Dr. Kirwin does acknowledge that some people will be “lucky,” while others may be “extremely unlucky.” “Even the lucky ones are going to have some kind of stress problem,” she says.

So for the sake of argument, let’s say our inmate was a juvenile diagnosed with ADHD pre-incarceration. His brain chemistry would be much different than an adult without any mental health issues, and therefore he would have a longer time going back to baseline. 

If the inmate had a substance abuse problem before entering jail and spent a significant period of time behind bars, including some time in solitary, he would be at an extreme risk for long term effects. 

And if our hypothetical inmate spent a full year in jail with elevated stress hormones, instead of just two days, we would likely be dealing with a different outcome.

The longer your stress hormones are elevated, the more psychological damage can occur, says Dr. Blandino. Elevated stress hormones can present a real risk for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or depression.

“They have to literally re-learn how to be a functioning human being without that rush of cortisol, without that fight-or-flight activation,” she says. “The nervous system is not as smart as the frontal lobe [which controls our personality and ability to communicate].”

What’s even more shocking is that physical brain damage can occur. Dr. Kirwin says structural changes in the brain can happen. “There are fewer connections between the neurons and the cerebral cortex gets thinner,” she says.  “The stress hormones that build up cause these neurons to die and these others (the top layer of the cortex) to thin. The longer the stress is there, the more damage is going to occur.”
 
According to Dr. Kirwin some of the factors involved with potential brain damage post-release from the elevated stress hormones is length of stay, type of facility (a jail is different in comfort level than a federal penitentiary), the brain chemistry baseline for that person, age (the younger they are, the more at risk they are), if they’ve had head injuries due to being in brawls or substance abuse issues, and any time spent in solitary confinement while incarcerated.

“What we see is how fragile the brain is, how fragile the cortex is,” says Dr. Kirwin. “We didn’t know that before. We thought [to see the level of damage] you had to hit somebody over the head. Now we’re seeing that you don’t even have to land a blow physically to create terrible changes in the brain.”
